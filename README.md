# TableTennis
A small version of Tennis using MVC framework.

Project of creating the classic table tennis game using MVC framework in Java.
To play, run MainGame.java as an application.

Still a work in progress. So far, I only have the JFrame window, both paddles and ball is drawn, 
Computer paddle follows the ball in one direction, the Player paddle can be moved up or down with
the arrow keys, but gets stuck at the top or the bottom of the panel. The ball bounces off of 
invisible walls so there is still a lot to be worked on.
